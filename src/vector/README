The vectormodule.c contains the C code for a Python 2D vector object.
I made it for fun, since the code really isn't much faster than implementing the object in Python.

I've included the source in order to build it on multiple platforms.

run:
> python setup.py build

and copy vector.so from within the 'build/.../' directory
